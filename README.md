# NMap_Reference_App
You can download the apk file for my NMap Refernce Guide App from here. Or just download the Source code and make your own

I built this app because I got tired of breaking my flow every time I needed to remember an Nmap flag, scan type, or port detail.

If you’ve ever:

Googled Nmap commands mid-assessment

Dug through PDFs in an air-gapped environment

Jumped between blogs, docs, and cheatsheets

Or worked in ICS/OT networks where internet access is restricted

…then this app exists for the same reason you’ve felt that pain.

Nmap Companion is an offline-first Android reference for people who actually use Nmap in real environments.

Simply download the apk file on your phone and install it, if there is a prompt to scan the app through Google Play store, click accept, or yes. (There are no viruses or RATs on the app, I swear). Once installed, it will be ready to use.

Right now, the app only works for Android environments, because I dont want to pay apple and am a bit lazy to post it as a webapp.
I will probably upload it sometime, but just not now -_-
